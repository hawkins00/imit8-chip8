Copyright Â© 2018 Chris Kim & Matt Hawkins

This is a virtual machine for interpreting [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) code. CHIP-8 is a minimal, interpreted language for creating simplistic games for 8-bit computers.

## Use
To load and run a ROM, place its path as the lone paramater to the program:
./imit8-chip8 dir/romfile.ch8

The program writes informative

## Future Plans
The graphic output of the VM is ascii- / console-based. The experience could be improved by using an OpenGL library for more responsive display updates. The library could also be used to create actual game beeps.
